# CoreWebAPI

To run the Angular front-end app, open cmd, then cd to project, and ng serve. Location: \CORNERSTONE ANGULAR .NET DEVELOPER INTERVIEW PROJECT\AngularWebAPI

http://localhost:4200/ will be the Angular front-end to interact with.

Next, open folder: \CORNERSTONE ANGULAR .NET DEVELOPER INTERVIEW PROJECT\CoreWebAPI
Open the CoreWebAPI.sln in the latest Visual Studio, or as recent as possible.
Click run.

This will open http://localhost:7271/swagger/index.html in another browser tab. You can use Swagger optionally, to stimulate each HTTP Web Method!

With both projects running, now go back to the http://localhost:4200/ tab, and you should see the page loaded without error in the console, or browser.

From here you can, click the add a new user button, then simply refresh the page. We use a local MongoDB, which is awesome how simple it is to use! This is the POST.

See app example code test.png in the CORNERSTONE ANGULAR .NET DEVELOPER INTERVIEW PROJECT folder for a demo example!

You can click the update a user button, it will auto choose User ID 1, and then refresh the page to see that it updated the users name. This is the PUT.

Then finally, see bottom of page for the GET by ID example, it automatically chose user ID 1 to look up that User. 

Finally, the entire list at the top of the page is the Get all Users demo, that list loads when the page refreshes.

This has been a really great demo and exercise, I had so much fun! I hope that you will have fun also!

Let me know if you have any questions, or when you'd like to further discuss the position. My time is yours!

Thanks for now,
Have a great weekend.
Best Regards,
